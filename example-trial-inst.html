	<p>
		This first trial will be a test run of how the interface works. In this trial, you will look for the following image below. It will be the first image at the top left hand corner. <i>Note that for the subsequent trials, the image to search for will NOT be in the same location.</i>
	</p>

	<div class="image">

	</div>

	<p> There is a timer in the bottom left hand corner of the screen that will automatically start counting time when you load the webpage. It will stop once you click on the object you need to locate. Do not manually click on the Start Timer/Stop Timer button in the bottom left hand corner. <i>Clicking on the correct object will stop the timer.</i> After clicking on the image on the next page, familiarize yourself with scrolling using the trackpad and using the arrows to navigate the page. After you are confident in your ability to do so, you may continue. To continue to the first recorded trial, click on the "Go To Next Trial" button below all the images.

	<p>
		When you are ready to start the example trial, click the start button below.
