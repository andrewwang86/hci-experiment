	<p>
		For this trial, remember the following image below. You will need to find it on the next webpage. Only use the specific navigation technique told to you by the experimenter (trackpad-scrolling or arrow-pressing) and do not use the other. 
	</p>

	<div class="image">
		<img src="pics/31.png">
	</div>

	<p>
		Try to find the image and click on it as fast as possible. Do not manually click on the Start Timer/Stop Timer button in the bottom left hand corner. Clicking on the correct object will stop the timer. After you have found the image you are looking for and the experimenter has recorded the time taken to find it, continue to the next trial by clicking the "Go to Next Trial" button below all the images.
